# ![Banner](banner.png)

Serenote is a project management discord bot, focused on convenience and ease of use. You can use this bot as a way to manage staff and moderators for your community server, or any other aspects to running your server. Why use a seperate application to manage discord, when you can use discord directly?

You can use the bot to keep track of...
- Tasks
- Notes
- Reminders
- Events
- Polls

## usage
You can [**invite the bot here**](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=761796288575438860&permissions=387136&scope=bot).
The bot is ~~still in development~~ *lmao*, expect some instability. Please remember to report any bugs, suggestions, or issues.

The prefix for the bot is `+`, Create your first task by doing `+task`!

## local setup
1. Create a `.env` in the repository root:
   ```yml
   TOKEN=discord.bot.token
   ```

2. Run `docker-compose up --build` in the repository root.
